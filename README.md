### Basic UI test examples 

The following files are part of an informal certification in Node.js and Selenium Webdriver offered by Matt Chiang with [Software Technology Group](https://stgconsulting.com/) and [QA at the Point](https://www.qap.dev/).

In this midst of this certification, the website we chose to write our tests against, [Copart.com](https://www.copart.com/), added Captcha to their website, which runs periodically. As such, these UI tests may or may not run successfully. We are in the process of finding a comparable website to test for the remainder of the certification. 

The code in this repo is heavily commented to reinforce my own understanding.
